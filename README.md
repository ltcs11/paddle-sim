# paddle-sim
optimize paddle static model with const folding and shape infer

## inspiration
1. onnx-sim:  
https://github.com/daquexian/onnx-simplifier

2. paddle shape infer:  
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle2ONNX/blob/develop/tools/paddle/paddle_infer_shape.py

## More to do
1. - [ ] support dynamic shape cases
2. - [ ] support more networks
